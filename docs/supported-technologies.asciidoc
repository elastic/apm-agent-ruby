== Supported technologies

The Elastic APM Ruby Agent has built-in support for many frameworks and
libraries.

Generally we want to support all the most popular libraries, so if your favorite
is missing feel free so request it in an issue or better yet supply a pull
request.

We follow Ruby's own maintenance policy and officially support all currently
maintained versions per
