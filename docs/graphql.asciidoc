[[graphql]]
== GraphQL (experimental)

The agent comes with support for GraphQL based APIs.

This slightly alters how transactions are named when they relate to GraphQL
queries, so they are easier to tell apart and debug.

To enable GraphQL support, add the included Tracer to your schema:

[source,ruby]
----
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  # ...

  tracer ElasticAPM::GraphQL # <-- include this
end
----
