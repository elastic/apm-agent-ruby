== Getting started with Rails

=== Setup

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'elastic-apm'
----

Create a file `config/elastic_apm.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
server_url: http://localhost:8100
secret_token: ''
----

This automatically sets up error logging and performance tracking but of course there are knobs to turn if you'd like to. See <<configuration>>.
